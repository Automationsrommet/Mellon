The Mellon is to be a hand held light weigth straigtforward text radio tying two people together if in relative proximity.
Also it is to be DIY friendly and completely open source hardware and softwarevise, and preferrably using only open source tools in the making.
Using the lower end cost of Lora radio tranciever chip one should be able to get good peer to peer contact using a simple integrated Yagi-Uda antenna. 
Then one might need to be facing the direction of the other to get contact, but I don't see this as being a problem, meerly a reality.
Now that I have my HAM lisence I can debate wether this should be a HAM radio or not. It being open and uncrypted is a good thing, and prohibits its use for spying and illegalities, or so I hope.
Here i will go more in to the frequency side of things shortly.
